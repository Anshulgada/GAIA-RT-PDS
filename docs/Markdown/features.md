# üåü Features

The project was originally targeted drone-based capture where drones transmit imagery and telemetry to a cloud server that runs the AI model (or alternatively runs on Jetson-class devices at the edge). The project also explored vehicle-mounted deployments, depth estimation via stereo vision or LiDAR, and Jetson-class GPU acceleration for embedded, real-time inference.
